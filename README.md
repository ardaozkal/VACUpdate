# VACUpdate
Make a list of Steam users and check their VAC Status. Basically [this](https://github.com/jung35/VacStatus) in PHP frontend and C# backend, and for use on personal servers (meh, spam and donate (btc: 38ehnuPM9PUbAxgmV13X7ygdDBTwGY17BN with note asking me to add a multi user feature or whatever to vacupdate) enough and I'll do it).
